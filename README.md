# DataStructure
Data Structure practice

1. Graph
  - Adjecency list  
  - Adjecemcy Matrix
  - DFS
  - BFS
  
2. Stack
- Min Stack : give min element in stack
- Multi stack : multiple stacks in single array
- Sorted stack: store sorted element in stack.
3. Trie
  - create dictionary from csv using Trie.
  4. Linked list
  - add (head / tail), 
  - delete (last, at index), 
  - intersection
  - reverse
  - remove duplicate nodes
  - concatanaition (+ and +=)
  - sorted merge
  - delete middle
  - partition at 
  - sum ( 321 + 654 = 975 1 -> 2 -> 3 and 4 -> 5 -> 6 result 5 -> 7 -> 9 )
  - is palindrome
  4. Tree
  - Binary Tree
  - Add node
  - Remove node
  - Mirror 
  - Left View
  - Right View
  - Bottom View
  - Top View
  - Print Level vise
  - Print zigzag
  - Print in-order
  - Print pre-order
  - Print post-order
  - Find succeder and preceder
  5. Others
  - 4Sum : list of subarrray of 4 element which total is given target (a + b + c + d = target)
  - BinarySum : sum of two binary number strings
  - possible_words_from_digit : give list of all posible words from given phone number
  - SumOfDigits : give sum of all digits in given number
  - fibonaci_cache: give fibonscii seriese upto n elements.
  6. ArrayProblems
  - Logest consticutime number sequence in given array
  - Set row and col 0 if element in matrix is 0
  - Rotate Matrix
  - Maximum difference between two elements such that larger element appears after the smaller number
  - Find the element that appears once in a sorted array
  - Find element which is not repeating.
  - Find missing number of Arithmatic series
  - Find missing number from array
  7. StringProblems
  - Sheck either string have unique characters
  - Check s1 and s2 anre permutation of each other
  - Check string is palindrom
  - Compress string for ex aaabbb give a3b3
  - Ckeck string 2 is made of from rotation of character of string 1
  - Check eithr string have substrign where atleast 3 ? in between 2 integer which total is less than 10
  - Check either string have unique characters
  - Count All Palindrome Sub-Strings in a String
  - Find the character in first string that is present at minimum index in second string
  - Given a string, find its first non-repeating character
  - list palindrome substring
